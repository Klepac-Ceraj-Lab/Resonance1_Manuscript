## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The gastrointestinal tract and nervous system are intricately linked,
and neuroactive compounds in the gut
may shape the developing brain.
In this cross-sectional study of over 300 children,
we find that the abundance of microbial genes for the metabolism of
GABA, glutamate, and other neuroactive molecules in the gut
are associated with differences
in the development of diverse brain regions
and overall cognitive ability.
